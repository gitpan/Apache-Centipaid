Q)I installed Apache::Centipaid and everything installed properly without 
any error messages.  However when I try to access a section that is
protected I get an apache error.  What is going on?

1)First insure that all the proper perl modules are installed.  You can simply
check that by running make test in the Apache::Centipaid directory.

---> if this condition is met, thenm proceed to next test

2)Check that the local database "centipaid_rcpt" is installed and can be accessed
  using the username/password specified in the configuration

---> if this condition is met, thenm proceed to next test

3)Check the error logs of your virtual host with Apache::Centipaid
 If you see an error log that references to CGI/Cookie.pm (see example)
 then you need to reinstall CGI.pm - We have included a tested version
 of CGI.pm in the contrib directory, however it is recommended to get the
 latest version from http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/

 >/usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/CGI/Cookie.pm line 75.

---> if this condition is met, thenm proceed to next test

4) Check which type of authetication has been chosen. i.e. is it an httpd.conf
   configuration? or an .htaccess

-->  If it is an httpd.conf and the steps above did not resolve it, please check
   support forum for more information.

--> If it is an .htaccess configuration, then you need to make sure that the
    the directory (document root) where the .htaccess is installed is allowed to 
    over-write httpd.cof settings.  Check that the following line is included
    in the httpd.conf

	<Directory "/var/www/demo.centipaid.com">
	    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
	    AllowOverride AuthConfig  #<---- this line must include AuthConfig
	    Order allow,deny
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>


5) If the problem persists, then upgrade the DBI::mysql package (a tested DBI::mysql)
   is included in contrib directory.
