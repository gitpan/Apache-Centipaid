Apache::Centipaid Frequently Asked questions
--------------------------------------------

Q) Why would I need Apache::Centipaid?
If you have a site that you want to grant paid access to then you may want to
choose between the Apache::Centipaid or the PHP module available at centipaid.com

If you have an existing site that already has mod_perl support, then Apache::Centipaid
will be a great tool since it will be invisible to your web developers and content
managers.  It does all teh work to direct user to pay, collect payment, and grant access.

Q) Can I see a demo?
Definetly! Centipaid has many demos showing the various types of businesses where
centipaid can be used.  The Apache::Centipaid is demonstrated at 
http://demo.centipaid.com

Q)I installed Apache::Centipaid and everything installed properly without 
any error messages.  However when I try to access a section that is
protected I get an apache error.  What is going on?

1)First insure that all the proper perl modules are installed.  You can simply
check that by running make test in the Apache::Centipaid directory.

---> if this condition is met, thenm proceed to next test

2)Check that the local database "centipaid_rcpt" is installed and can be accessed
  using the username/password specified in the configuration

---> if this condition is met, thenm proceed to next test

3)Check the error logs of your virtual host with Apache::Centipaid
 If you see an error log that references to CGI/Cookie.pm (see example)
 then you need to reinstall CGI.pm - We have included a tested version
 of CGI.pm in the contrib directory, however it is recommended to get the
 latest version from http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/

 >/usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/CGI/Cookie.pm line 75.

---> if this condition is met, thenm proceed to next test

4) Check which type of authetication has been chosen. i.e. is it an httpd.conf
   configuration? or an .htaccess

-->  If it is an httpd.conf and the steps above did not resolve it, please check
   support forum for more information.

--> If it is an .htaccess configuration, then you need to make sure that the
    the directory (document root) where the .htaccess is installed is allowed to 
    over-write httpd.cof settings.  Check that the following line is included
    in the httpd.conf

	<Directory "/var/www/demo.centipaid.com">
	    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
	    AllowOverride AuthConfig  #<---- this line must include AuthConfig
	    Order allow,deny
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>


5) If the problem persists, then upgrade the DBI::mysql package (a tested DBI::mysql)
   is included in contrib directory.
