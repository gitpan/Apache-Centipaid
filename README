Quick Install
--------------------------------------------------------
To install:

A. Create table in existing database, or create a new database 
   and table

B. Compile the Apache::Centipaid module
    cd Apache-Centipaid=x.xx
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

C. Insert configuration in httpd.com or .htaccess
    Edit either the httpd.conf or htaccess depending
    on your preference, to refelect the rate you want to 
    charge for access to your site.  
    
    Ideally httpd.conf is used to set a rate for a site
    or a major part of the site, while .htaccess files 
    are designed for sites that have many different rates 
    for different sections, so they can have the desired
    reseved for paid customers


A) SQL Database Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The payment system requieres that the receipts are stored at the site 
providing the service, and the module interfaces with any SQL-based
database.

To setup your database, use the following command to load into mysql

cd Apache-Centipaid=x.xx
mysql database < sql/mysql.sql

or use any database client such as phpMyAdmin to create a table in
an accessible database.

CREATE TABLE rcpt (
  rcpt varchar(100) NOT NULL default '',
  date datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  expire datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  paid double NOT NULL default '0',
  ip varchar(100) default NULL,
  zone varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (rcpt)
);


Where:
rcpt stores the recipt number
date and expire contain the date the receipt was 
issued on the site, and its expiration. 
Paid contains the amount paid in float format.  
IP contains the IP of the client who made the payment. 
zone is used for statistical purposes, where the website admin 
can see what sections are being used most.
